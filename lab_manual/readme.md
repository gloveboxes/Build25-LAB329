## Welcome to Distillation Labe for Build 2025 

This lab manual is designed specifically for beginners and includes:

- Introduction section explaining knowledge distillation concepts
- Detailed instructions for both:
- Cloud-based distillation using Azure AI Foundry
- Local-based distillation for those without Azure access
- Time allocations for each step to ensure completion within the specified:
- 50 minutes for hands-on activities
- 20 minutes for reading/theory
- 70 minutes total time

The manual has a clear structure with step-by-step instructions, code examples, and explanations of the distillation process. We have also included evaluation metrics to help users assess their distilled models and additional resources for further learning.

The lab is designed to be practical and achievable in the time constraints, focusing on the core aspects of distillation while providing enough theoretical background for beginners to understand the concepts.
