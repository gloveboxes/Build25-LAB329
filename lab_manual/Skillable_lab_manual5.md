# Step 5: Download the Model (5 min)

**Notebook:** `05.Local_Download.ipynb`

**Purpose:** Download the registered model from Azure ML to your Skillable VM for local deployment and inference. You will be running this notebook from the Skillable VM. Please open the folder `C:\Users\LabUser\Desktop\lab\Build25-LAB329\Lab329\Notebook` which is located on the desktop of your VM in a folder called `lab`.

# Local Model Download

This notebook (`05.Local_Download.ipynb`) focuses on downloading the fine-tuned and optimized model from Azure Machine Learning to a local environment for deployment or inference.

## Purpose

After fine-tuning and optimizing our model in the cloud, this notebook enables you to:
1. Download the ONNX-formatted model to your local environment
2. Access model files for deployment on edge devices or integration with local applications
3. Use the model in scenarios that require offline inference capabilities

## Troubleshooting Guide

The notebook includes specific troubleshooting guidance for common issues:

- **Authentication Issues**: Instructions for re-authenticating using `az login --use-device-code`
- **Missing Environment Variables**: Guidance on setting up the `local.env` file
- **Model Not Found**: Steps to verify model existence and permissions
- **Download Failures**: Alternative approaches and fallback mechanisms
- **Path Resolution Issues**: Techniques to locate downloaded model when path is not returned

## Next Steps

After downloading the model:

1. Use the model for local inference with ONNX Runtime or other compatible frameworks
2. Deploy the model to edge devices or embedded systems
3. Integrate the model with custom applications or services
4. Compare performance metrics between cloud deployment and local inference

This notebook completes the knowledge distillation pipeline by bringing the optimized model back to the local environment, where it can be deployed and used in various scenarios outside of Azure ML.
