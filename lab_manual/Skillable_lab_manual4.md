# Model Registration to Azure Machine Learning

This notebook (`04.AzureML_RegisterToAzureML.ipynb`) implements the fourth phase of our model distillation pipeline: registering the optimized model to Azure Machine Learning. This step ensures the model is properly cataloged and available for deployment or sharing with other users.

## Purpose

This notebook demonstrates the model registration process by:
1. Connecting to an Azure Machine Learning workspace
2. Creating a model entity with appropriate metadata
3. Uploading the optimized ONNX model to the Azure ML model registry
4. Making the model available for future inference or deployment

## Workflow Overview

1. **Environment Setup**: Installing necessary packages and importing required libraries
2. **Authentication**: Connecting to Azure ML using the Azure Identity library
3. **Model Definition**: Creating a model entity with appropriate metadata
4. **Model Registration**: Uploading and registering the model to the Azure ML registry

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Centralized Management**: Azure ML provides a central repository for all models
2. **Version Control**: Automatic versioning helps track model evolution
3. **Governance**: Maintains proper documentation and metadata for models
4. **Discoverability**: Makes models available to authorized team members
5. **Deployment Integration**: Simplifies the process of deploying the model to endpoints

This notebook completes the production preparation cycle by registering the optimized model in a central repository. By registering the model in Azure ML, we make it available for further deployment scenarios, sharing with team members, or integration into production pipelines. The registration process also ensures proper versioning and documentation, which is crucial for model governance and compliance.
